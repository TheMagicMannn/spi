# SPICE Dating App - Supabase Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works)
- Git installed

## Step 1: Supabase Project Setup

### 1.1 Create a Supabase Project
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "New Project"
4. Fill in:
   - Project name: `spice-dating-app`
   - Database password: (save this securely)
   - Region: Choose closest to your users
5. Wait for project to be created (~2 minutes)

### 1.2 Get Your Project Credentials
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

## Step 2: Database Setup

### 2.1 Run the Database Schema
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` from this repository
4. Paste into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the schema

This will create:
- All necessary tables (profiles, matches, messages, swipes, etc.)
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic triggers for matching
- Default interests

### 2.2 Set Up Storage Buckets
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click "Create a new bucket"
3. Name it: `photos`
4. Make it **Public** (so profile photos can be accessed)
5. Click "Create bucket"

### 2.3 Configure Storage Policies
1. Click on the `photos` bucket
2. Go to **Policies** tab
3. Add these policies:

**Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to upload**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'photos');
```

**Policy 2: Allow public read access**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can view photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'photos');
```

**Policy 3: Allow users to delete their own photos**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'photos' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## Step 3: Local Development Setup

### 3.1 Clone and Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TheMagicMannn/Spiceapp.git
cd Spiceapp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 3.2 Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 3.3 Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`

## Step 4: Testing the Application

### 4.1 Create Your First Account
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in your details (must be 18+)
4. Check your email for verification link
5. Click the verification link
6. Complete your profile setup:
   - Choose profile type (single/couple)
   - Add basic info
   - Write a bio
   - Select interests
   - Upload at least 2 photos

### 4.2 Test Core Features
1. **Discovery**: Swipe through profiles
2. **Matching**: Like profiles to create matches
3. **Messaging**: Send messages to matches
4. **Profile**: View and edit your profile

## Step 5: Deployment

### 5.1 Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Add environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
5. Deploy!

### 5.2 Environment Variables for Production
Make sure to add the same environment variables in your deployment platform:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"
**Solution**: Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains the correct values. Restart the dev server after adding them.

### Issue: "Failed to create profile"
**Solution**: 
1. Check that the database schema was run successfully
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
3. Check browser console for specific errors

### Issue: Photos not uploading
**Solution**:
1. Verify the `photos` storage bucket exists
2. Check that storage policies are configured
3. Ensure the bucket is set to public

### Issue: No profiles showing in discovery
**Solution**:
1. Create multiple test accounts
2. Make sure profiles are completed
3. Check that RLS policies allow profile viewing

## Security Notes

### Important Security Considerations:
1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They're in `.gitignore` for a reason
2. **Use Row Level Security** - Already configured in the schema
3. **Validate user input** - Client and server-side validation
4. **Age verification** - Enforced at signup (18+)
5. **Report/Block features** - Available for user safety

## Database Schema Overview

### Main Tables:
- **profiles**: User profile information
- **swipes**: Track likes/passes
